# Subdomain Scanner and Vulnerability Checker
This Python script allows you to scan for subdomains of a specified domain and check for vulnerabilities in each subdomain found. It utilizes the Subfinder tool for subdomain discovery and Nmap for vulnerability scanning.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Docker (for Subfinder)
* Nmap
* requests library (pip install requests)
## Installation
1. - Install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. - Install Nmap from [Nmap's official website](https://nmap.org/download.html).
3. - Install the requests library by running pip install requests.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the provided Python script (main.py) to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the following command:
 ```bash
python3 CVE.py
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the domain to search for subdomains and specify the output file.

5. Once the script completes, it will display the subdomains found and check each subdomain for reachability and vulnerabilities.

## Notes
Ensure that Docker is installed and running before executing the script, as it relies on Docker for running Subfinder.
Depending on the network and the number of subdomains found, the script execution may take some time.
The script utilizes the Subfinder tool for subdomain discovery and Nmap for vulnerability scanning. Make sure they are correctly installed and accessible in your environment.
## Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational and informational purposes only. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any network or system.
